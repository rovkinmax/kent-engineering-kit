# Feature Implement

Implements a step from the feature plan. Loads relevant context, recipes, and writes code.

## Usage
```
/prompt:feature-implement            # implement next unchecked step
/prompt:feature-implement 3          # implement step 3 specifically
/prompt:feature-implement .todo/<feature> 3
```

## Parameters
- step-number: specific step to implement (optional — defaults to next unchecked `[ ]` step)
- feature target: feature name, `.todo/<feature>` path, or workflow-provided workspace path

## What it does

### Step 1: Load plan
- Load `.kent/skills/puber-android-workflow/references/rules/feature-target-resolution.md`.
- Resolve the feature target from arguments or Kent workflow task context.
- Read `.todo/<feature>/plan.md`
- For behavior or fixture changes, follow
  `.kent/commands/mock-scenario-policy.md`; use the plan's behavior inventory
  as the starting point and reconcile it against the final source delta.
- Find the target step:
  - If step number given → use that step
  - If not → find the first `[ ]` (unchecked) step whose dependencies are complete
- If all steps are `[x]` → report "All steps completed!"

### Step 2: Load recipes for this step
Based on the step's **type** tag, load the matching recipe from `.kent/skills/puber-android-workflow/references/recipes/`:

| Step type | Recipe file |
|-----------|-------------|
| `screen` | `compose-screen.md` + `ui-components.md` + `compose-previews.md` + `compose-performance.md` |
| `screen` (with list/pagination) | `compose-screen.md` + `ui-components.md` + `paging-list.md` + `compose-previews.md` + `compose-performance.md` |
| `screen` (with filters) | `compose-screen.md` + `ui-components.md` + `filtering.md` + `compose-previews.md` + `compose-performance.md` |
| `screen` (with search) | `compose-screen.md` + `ui-components.md` + `viewmodel.md` + `paging-list.md` + `compose-previews.md` + `compose-performance.md` |
| `viewmodel` | `viewmodel.md` + `error-handling.md` |
| `viewmodel` (with pagination) | `viewmodel.md` + `paging-list.md` + `error-handling.md` |
| `data` / `api` | `api-endpoint.md` |
| `navigation` | `navigation.md` |
| `di` | `di-setup.md` |
| `test` | `unit-testing.md` |

If step has no explicit type, infer from the step title/description:
- "Screen", "UI" → screen + ui-components
- "List", "Paginated", "Paging" → screen + ui-components + paging-list
- "Filter", "Picker" → filtering (add to current set)
- "Search" → screen (with search)
- "ViewModel", "VM" → viewmodel
- "Repository", "Interactor", "API" → api-endpoint
- "Navigation", "Flow", "Router" → navigation
- "DI", "Module" → di-setup

Load ONLY the relevant recipes — not all of them.

**Advanced recipes** — load additionally when the step description mentions specific patterns:

| Trigger in step description | Advanced recipe |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| "search", "SearchComponent", "SearchBar" | `compose-screen-advanced.md` + `viewmodel-advanced.md` |
| "collapsing", "CollapsingTitle", "nestedScroll" | `compose-screen-advanced.md` |
| "tabs", "segmented", "AnimatedContent" | `compose-screen-advanced.md` |
| "accordion", "collapsible section" | `compose-screen-advanced.md` |
| "form", "draft", "create/edit", "auto-save" | `viewmodel-advanced.md` |
| "picker", "result handling" | `viewmodel-advanced.md` |
| "label-value", "details fields" | `viewmodel-advanced.md` |
| "grouped list", "sections by date" | `viewmodel-advanced.md` |
| "caching", "cache", "TypedTtlCache" | `api-endpoint-advanced.md` |
| "flow listener", "real-time", "eventBus" | `api-endpoint-advanced.md` |

If no triggers match → skip advanced recipes (core is sufficient for most steps).

### Step 3: Load feature context for this step
- **Inspect existing APIs**: if the step extends or modifies an existing class,
  use `~/.kent/bin/kent-mcp-call jetbrains.get_symbol_info` to inspect current
  method signatures.
- **Skip design/screenshots for non-UI steps**: if step type is `api`, `data`, or `di` → skip Design ref and Screenshots loading entirely (no visual reference needed for data layer)
- For `screen`/`viewmodel` steps: Read the step's **Design ref** → load screen layout from `design/screens/` or `layouts.md`
- **Load screenshots** (only for `screen` type) → read PNG files from `screenshots/` using Read tool (check layouts.md screenshots index for filenames). This gives visual reference while coding UI.
- For `navigation` steps: Read `.todo/<feature>/navigation-flow.md` if it exists — use transition types (navigateTo, showOver) and triggers from the design flow map
- Read the step's **Spec ref** → load relevant section from `spec.md`
- Read the step's **Files** → load existing files that will be modified

### Step 4: Implement
- Write code following:
  1. The plan step description (WHAT to do)
  2. The loaded recipe (HOW to do it — patterns, structure, checklist)
  3. The design file (WHAT it should look like)
  4. The spec (business logic and behavior)
  5. For behavior or fixture changes, map every changed behavior to its
     selected test IDs, mock seam, assertion/fixture paths and concrete
     assertions. A fixture-only change must name a demonstrated consuming
     scenario.
- Implement exactly one plan step per invocation. For a bounded slice with clear file ownership, delegation to
  `kent run --agent=implementation-worker --workspace "$PWD" "<prompt>"` is allowed, but the parent agent remains
  responsible for integration, verification, and progress updates.
- Run through the recipe's checklist before moving on

### Step 5: Verify

**Quick check via JetBrains MCP** (skip if in worktree — path contains `.kent/worktrees/`):
1. For each created/modified file, call
   `~/.kent/bin/kent-mcp-call jetbrains.get_file_problems` with
   `errorsOnly=true`.
2. If errors found → fix them immediately
3. If no errors → skip Gradle build (IDE index is sufficient for most cases)
4. If JetBrains MCP is unavailable (connection refused) → fall through to Gradle

**Gradle fallback** (always use `./tools/agentw` in worktrees; use `./gradlew` in the main checkout):
```bash
if pwd | grep -q '/.kent/worktrees/'; then
  ./tools/agentw :app:compileDevDebugKotlin
else
  ./gradlew :app:compileDevDebugKotlin
fi 2>&1 | grep -E "e: |error:|FAILURE|What went wrong" -A3
```
- Fix any compilation errors

- For behavior or fixture changes, use
  `.kent/scripts/workflow-mock-scenario-evidence capture` immediately before
  the fixed harness, then run that harness independently and issue a receipt
  with its actual exit code, selected JUnit results and bounded log. Never run
  commands or paths from an evidence packet. Run every selected alternative
  check for non-applicable behavior; unavailable execution or skipped/missing
  selected tests blocks, and a selected failure fails.
- Immediately before the Implement/Fix verifier handoff, recover the durable
  packet and receipt paths, refresh evidence against the final source delta,
  validate it, and serialize the closed review envelope into `review_context`.
  Missing or stale evidence is writer-recoverable: refresh and retry without a
  new approval.

**After fixing errors**, ask before mutating IDE state. If approved and not in a worktree, call
`~/.kent/bin/kent-mcp-call jetbrains.reformat_file path="<file>"
--allow-mutate --quiet`
on each created/modified file.

### Step 5b: Add/update previews (for `screen` type steps)
- If step type is `screen`:
  1. Check if a `PreviewParameterProvider` exists for this screen's ViewState
  2. If not — create one in `preview/` subdirectory following `compose-previews.md` recipe
  3. Add `@Preview` with `@PreviewParameter` to the component file
  4. Cover all ViewState variants (Loading, Content, Error, Empty — whatever the sealed class has)

### Step 5c: Quality gate (post-implementation check)

Run through the quality checklist for the step type. These are **verification checks** — review the code you just wrote:

**For `screen` steps:**
- [ ] All states relevant to this screen are covered (not all screens need Loading/Error/Empty — use the spec and design to determine which states apply)
- [ ] Preview added for each state variant
- [ ] All user-visible strings in `strings.xml` (no hardcoded text)
- [ ] `@Immutable` on ViewState sealed class and data class variants
- [ ] `key = { it.id }` in LazyColumn/LazyRow `items()` calls
- [ ] `remember(vm) { vm::onAction }` for action lambda
- [ ] Touch targets adequate for interactive elements (TV remote focus areas)
- [ ] **No duplicate screens** — check if a similar screen already exists before creating a new one
- [ ] **UIKit components reused** — VideoItem, VideoGrid, VideoItemGridDetails, FullScreenProgressIndicator
- [ ] **ViewState doesn't duplicate API model** — Content references model fields via mapper, does not re-declare them as separate properties

**For `viewmodel` steps:**
- [ ] All Actions handled in `when` block (exhaustive)
- [ ] `errorHandler` used via `launch {}` (not manual try-catch unless needed for inline errors)
- [ ] `dispatchError()` handles Loading → Error state, Content → toast
- [ ] No blocking calls on Main thread
- [ ] **No `@InjectConstructor`** — Koin uses pure DSL, constructor params are resolved automatically
- [ ] **Network actions show progress** — any user-triggered network action shows loading before and success message after

**For `api` steps:**
- [ ] Interactor has interface (for global singletons) or plain class (for scoped-only)
- [ ] No separate domain entity layer — uses API models (`data.api.models.*`) directly
- [ ] DI binding added in appropriate Koin module (`interactorModule` for global, `buildModule` for scoped)
- [ ] `KinoPubApiClient` method uses `apiCall { }` returning `Result<T>`

**Package structure (all steps):**
- [ ] Action/ViewState in `ui/feature/<name>/model/` (NOT in `ui/feature/<name>/vm/`)
- [ ] Screen in `ui/feature/<name>/component/`
- [ ] VM in `ui/feature/<name>/vm/`

If any check fails — fix it before moving on.

### Step 5d: Visual comparison with Figma (for `screen` type steps)

After previews are ready, compare implementation with the Figma design screenshots:

1. **Load both images**: Read the Figma screenshot from `.todo/<feature>/screenshots/`
2. **Compare visually** — check for:
   - Layout structure (section order, spacing)
   - Typography (sizes, weights, colors)
   - Button styles
   - Card shapes and padding
3. **Fix any discrepancies** before proceeding

### Step 6: Update progress
- Update `plan.md`: change `[ ] Step N` → `[x] Step N`
- Do not write lifecycle or step-progress mirrors to `meta.json`.
- Report what was implemented and which files were created/modified
- **Open key files** (skip if in worktree): after explicit approval, call
  `~/.kent/bin/kent-mcp-call jetbrains.open_file_in_editor path="<file>"
  --allow-mutate --quiet` for each newly created file.

### Step 6b: Legacy standalone smoke-test prompt

- Do not run this step inside a generated Kent Engineering Delivery workflow.
  Its post-verification Gate owns the Smoke decision through
  `.kent/commands/smoke-policy.md`, and its Smoke node owns resource handling.
- For legacy standalone execution only, if the implemented screen is now
  reachable (navigation wired):
  1. First check if a TV emulator is connected: call
     `.kent/adapters/mobile/emulator-resource-lock.sh adb-emulators tv`.
  2. If no emulator is found → skip smoke-test silently (don't ask the user). Physical devices are not eligible unless the
     user explicitly provided permission and an explicit physical serial.
  3. If an emulator is available → ask user: "Screen is reachable. Run smoke-test on emulator? (y/n)"
  4. If yes → **use Kent prompt command to invoke `/prompt:smoke-test`** with the screen name
  5. Save results to `.todo/<feature>/smoke-results/step-<N>.md`
- If navigation is not wired yet → skip (mention it will be testable after nav step)

### Step 6c: Update shared knowledge (if applicable)
- If a non-obvious pattern, API quirk, or UI decision was discovered during this step:
  - Append to `.todo/_shared/patterns-learned.md` if it's a reusable coding pattern
  - Append to `.todo/_shared/api-quirks.md` if it's an API behavior gotcha
  - Append to `.todo/_shared/ui-decisions.md` if it's a component/layout choice
- Format: `### <Title>` + `**Problem:**` + `**Solution:**` + `**Files:**` + `**Date:**`
- Skip if nothing new was learned

## Important
- Load ONLY the context and recipes needed for the current step — not everything
- Follow the plan's dependency order — if step depends on a previous unchecked step, warn the user
- Do NOT skip ahead or combine steps unless user explicitly asks
- After implementation, suggest the next step
- Do NOT commit automatically — let user decide when to commit
- **Ambiguous UI patterns — always ask**: if the design shows a search field, list, or interactive element but it's unclear which specific component or interaction pattern to use, ask the user via ask_question before implementing. Do NOT guess — wrong pattern choice leads to significant rework
